# Security Backlog

Findings from the Phase 6 audit that are not fixed in v1.3. Entries are
grouped by target version. Short descriptions only; the original Phase 6
audit report (V-IDs) is the authoritative source for exploit steps and
impact analysis.

Chain exploits from the audit are documented at the end with a note on
which individual fixes break them.

---

## Accepted Risks

Findings that were evaluated and intentionally not fixed. Each entry
keeps the original audit severity (no downgrade), states the reason,
and names the condition that would cause us to revisit. Listed here
so the next audit and future maintainers can read the history without
reconstructing it from chat logs.

### V-006 -- Fernet cipher instance cached globally in module state

Status: Accepted risk (v1.4)
Severity: Medium (as flagged by audit)

`_fernet` is a module-level cache, so the Fernet key material lives in
process memory for the lifetime of the gunicorn worker. Best-effort
zeroing is not possible in pure Python: strings are immutable and
garbage collection runs on its own schedule, so `del _fernet` does
not scrub the bytes. A local attacker with a core dump or ptrace can
recover the key regardless of what Python code does.

Rotating the module-level cache to a per-request cache would reduce
the window slightly but would not change the outcome and would add a
cost on every encrypt/decrypt. The threat model already assumes a
local-read adversary on the API host cannot be defeated by in-process
obfuscation; the same adversary can read `SENTRY_ENCRYPTION_KEY` from
the process environment directly.

Revisit when:
- Key handling moves to an external KMS (AWS/GCP/Vault) where the
  process only holds short-lived decrypted blobs
- Key handling moves to a native extension that can mlock and
  explicitly zero memory
- A hardened deployment profile (SaaS) requires a stronger local
  posture

### V-048 -- Cleartext HTTP allowed in all build profiles

Status: Accepted risk (v1.4)
Severity: High (as flagged by audit)

Sentry WMS is deployed on warehouse LANs where HTTPS certificates are
impractical. Clone-and-run users and LAN-only production deployments both
require cleartext HTTP. Profile-gated enforcement was attempted in v1.1 and
reverted in v1.1.1 because it broke real deployments.

Domain-scoped cleartext (Android `network_security_config.xml` restricting
cleartext to RFC1918 ranges) is the most likely future mitigation if this
needs to change.

Revisit when:
- A hosted/cloud deployment option ships (Sentry Cloud SaaS)
- A user requests HTTPS-only enforcement
- Public deployments outside LANs become a supported use case

## Target v1.4 (Deferred High)

### V-045 -- JWT stored in admin panel localStorage
- **Severity:** High
- **Category:** AI-Pattern
- **Description:** The admin SPA stores the bearer JWT in
  `localStorage.sentry_token`. Any XSS primitive on the admin origin
  exfiltrates it instantly; HttpOnly cookies are not an option without
  a CSRF refactor.
- **Suggested fix:** Move session to `HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict`
  cookie. Add double-submit CSRF token for state-changing routes.
  Requires coordinated backend + frontend change.
- **Target version:** v1.4.

### V-047 -- Mobile JWT in AsyncStorage (plaintext)
- **Severity:** High
- **Category:** Infrastructure
- **Description:** React Native app stores the 8-hour JWT in
  `AsyncStorage`, which is unencrypted SQLite on Android and an
  unprotected plist on iOS. `expo-secure-store` is already declared as
  a dependency but never imported.
- **Suggested fix:** Replace every `AsyncStorage.getItem/setItem` that
  touches `jwt_token` or `user_data` with `SecureStore.getItemAsync /
  setItemAsync`. Migrate existing installed clients by falling back to
  AsyncStorage on first launch then rewriting into SecureStore.
- **Target version:** v1.4.

### V-048 -- Mobile cleartext HTTP forcibly enabled
- **Severity:** High
- **Category:** Infrastructure
- **Description:** `mobile/app.json` and `mobile/plugins/
  with-cleartext-traffic.js` unconditionally enable cleartext HTTP in
  every build profile. CHANGELOG v1.1.0 claimed this was fixed; the
  fix was reverted in commit `ff36caf` for warehouse-deployment
  convenience and the changelog was not updated.
- **Suggested fix:** Gate the plugin on `process.env.EAS_BUILD_PROFILE !==
  "production"`. Coordinate with the warehouse deployments that
  actually rely on cleartext (they should migrate to a local TLS
  reverse proxy instead).
- **Target version:** v1.4.

### V-050 -- No Content-Security-Policy header
- **Severity:** High
- **Category:** AI-Pattern
- **Description:** The API sets X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options,
  X-XSS-Protection, Referrer-Policy, and Permissions-Policy, but NOT
  Content-Security-Policy. Without CSP a successful XSS can exfiltrate
  to any origin.
- **Suggested fix:** Add `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self';
  script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'
  https://fonts.googleapis.com; font-src https://fonts.gstatic.com;
  connect-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'; base-uri 'self';
  form-action 'self'`. Test carefully against the admin SPA, especially
  Google Fonts preconnects and inline styles from the React component
  library.
- **Target version:** v1.4.

## Mediums

### V-006 -- Fernet cached globally in module state
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Category:** Sensitive-Info
- **Description:** `_fernet` is a module-level cache, so the Fernet key
  lives in process memory for the process lifetime.
- **Suggested fix:** Per-request cache or a `SecretBytes` wrapper that
  zeroes memory after use (best-effort in Python).
- **Target version:** backlog.

### V-007 -- Celery task tracebacks may leak credentials
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Category:** Sensitive-Info
- **Description:** If a connector ever builds a URL with userinfo
  (`https://key:secret@host`), a network error's `str(exc)` pulled into
  `logger.error` or `sync_state.last_error_message` can leak the
  credential.
- **Suggested fix:** Scrub userinfo from URLs before logging; audit
  connector implementations for any credential-in-URL pattern.
- **Target version:** v1.4.

### V-008 -- Missing SENTRY_ENCRYPTION_KEY auto-regeneration risk
- **Severity:** Medium (closed by V-001)
- **Category:** AI-Pattern
- **Description:** Noted in Phase 6 as a distinct item; in practice
  addressed by V-001 which hard-fails on missing key.
- **Target version:** Done (bundled into V-001).

### V-010 -- Connector name collision silently overwrites
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Category:** Chain
- **Description:** `ConnectorRegistry.register()` assigns to the dict
  with no duplicate guard. A second `registry.register("netsuite",
  EvilConnector)` wins silently.
- **Suggested fix:** Raise `ValueError` on duplicate name. Pin an
  allowlist of connector module names that auto-register.
- **Target version:** v1.4.

### V-016 -- Content-Type not explicitly required on POST endpoints
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Category:** Injection
- **Description:** `validate_body` uses `request.get_json(silent=True)`
  which returns None for non-JSON bodies. Pydantic then validates `{}`
  and fails clean today, but a future `force=True` slip would allow
  non-JSON bodies through.
- **Suggested fix:** Explicitly reject requests without
  `Content-Type: application/json` with 415.
- **Target version:** backlog.

### V-020 -- ErrorBoundary writes full error to console.error
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Category:** Sensitive-Info
- **Description:** React error boundary logs the full error object.
  On a shared workstation or with a malicious browser extension this
  leaks sensitive context (API URLs, potentially Authorization header
  reconstruction).
- **Suggested fix:** Scrub tokens before logging; POST a sanitized
  telemetry event to the backend instead of `console.error`.
- **Target version:** v1.4.

### V-021 -- Admin UI renders raw backend error strings
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Category:** Sensitive-Info
- **Description:** Several admin pages display `data.error` verbatim.
  React's default escaping prevents XSS, but backend internals (SQL
  constraint names, Python exception reprs) end up on screen.
- **Suggested fix:** Define a finite error-code enum on the backend;
  map codes to localized strings in the frontend.
- **Target version:** v1.4.

### V-024 -- login_attempts table grows unbounded
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Category:** DoS
- **Description:** The login_attempts rate-limit table accumulates one
  row per unique username or IP key. No cleanup job. An attacker
  spraying random usernames can bloat the table indefinitely.
- **Suggested fix:** Celery beat task that deletes rows older than one
  hour. Cap key length at the schema level.
- **Target version:** v1.4.

### V-031 -- Last-admin delete race
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Category:** Logic
- **Description:** With two admins, two simultaneous DELETE /users/X
  requests each see `admin_count = 2` and both proceed, leaving zero
  admins.
- **Suggested fix:** Wrap the check in `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` on a
  serialization lock row, or enforce a deferred `CHECK` that at least
  one active admin exists.
- **Target version:** v1.4.

### V-033 -- URL-path warehouse_id bypasses middleware check
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Category:** IDOR
- **Description:** `require_auth`'s warehouse check only reads
  `warehouse_id` from request body or query string, not from path
  parameters. Routes must call `check_warehouse_access()` or
  `warehouse_scope_clause()` explicitly. Most already do; this is a
  defense-in-depth gap.
- **Suggested fix:** Teach the middleware to inspect view args too, or
  add a CI lint that flags new routes that take `warehouse_id` in the
  path without also calling the helper.
- **Target version:** v1.4.

### V-034 -- Picking service error messages leak IDs
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Category:** Sensitive-Info
- **Description:** `ValueError("SO X is in a different warehouse")` and
  similar messages in picking_service are relayed to the client,
  enabling cross-tenant SO enumeration.
- **Suggested fix:** Collapse to a single generic message
  ("not found or access denied") for non-admins.
- **Target version:** v1.4.

### V-035 -- Celery worker bind-mounts host source tree
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Category:** Infrastructure
- **Description:** Default `docker-compose.yml` mounts `./api:/app`
  into the celery-worker container, so an RCE in the worker persists
  by writing to the host tree.
- **Suggested fix:** Remove the bind mount from the default compose.
  The dev overlay (`docker-compose.dev.yml`, introduced in V-003)
  already holds the mount.
- **Target version:** v1.4.

### V-040 -- API and admin bound to 0.0.0.0 by default
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Category:** Infrastructure
- **Description:** `docker-compose.yml` publishes `5000:5000` and
  `8080:8080` without an interface prefix. On a public-cloud host this
  exposes the API and admin UI to the internet.
- **Suggested fix:** Change to `127.0.0.1:5000:5000` /
  `127.0.0.1:8080:8080`. Deployments that need external access override
  in their own compose.
- **Target version:** v1.4.

### V-041 -- No rate limiting beyond /auth/login
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Category:** DoS
- **Description:** Every other endpoint (sync trigger, credential test,
  receive, pick, etc.) can be hit at full rate by any authenticated
  user. Combined with V-009's (now closed) SSRF surface, unthrottled
  test_connection was a scanning primitive.
- **Suggested fix:** Add Flask-Limiter with per-user and per-IP token
  buckets. Lower limit for connector/test, higher for mobile scan
  paths.
- **Target version:** v1.4.

### V-042 -- No pip-audit / npm-audit in CI
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Category:** Supply-chain
- **Description:** `admin/package.json` uses `^` ranges and the admin
  Dockerfile (post-V-003) uses `npm ci`. Backend uses pinned versions
  but no audit job.
- **Suggested fix:** Add a CI step that runs `pip-audit` and
  `npm audit --audit-level=high` and fails the build on high-severity
  advisories.
- **Target version:** v1.4.

### V-046 -- No Subresource Integrity on admin bundle
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Category:** AI-Pattern
- **Description:** Built asset tags in `admin/index.html` ship without
  `integrity="sha384-..."` attributes. Combined with V-050 (no CSP), a
  static-host compromise or CDN poisoning could rewrite the bundle.
- **Suggested fix:** Enable a Vite SRI plugin in the build.
- **Target version:** v1.4.

### V-051 -- No HSTS header
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Category:** Infrastructure
- **Description:** Response headers do not include
  `Strict-Transport-Security`.
- **Suggested fix:** Set `max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains` when
  TLS terminates at the reverse proxy.
- **Target version:** v1.4.

### V-058 -- Lockout DoS + last-admin delete race chain
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Category:** Chain
- **Description:** Two-step chain combining V-023 (closed) and V-031
  (open). With V-023 closed the first leg no longer fires, but V-031
  alone remains an admin-wipe risk.
- **Suggested fix:** Depends on V-031.
- **Target version:** v1.4 (blocked by V-031).

### V-059 -- CSV formula -> Excel RCE chain
- **Severity:** Medium (closed by V-015)
- **Category:** Chain
- **Description:** Now closed by V-015. Import-side sanitization
  prevents the payload from ever landing in the DB; export-side
  sanitizer was already present in `DataTable`.
- **Target version:** Done.

### V-060 -- update_settings not audited
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Category:** Logic
- **Description:** POST /api/admin/settings updates `app_settings`
  without writing to audit_log. A compromised admin can silently flip
  `allow_over_receipt` or `require_packing_before_shipping`.
- **Suggested fix:** `write_audit_log` before commit with the key,
  old value, and new value. Audit-log tamper resistance (V-025) now
  makes those records durable.
- **Target version:** v1.4.

### V-072 -- Source bind mounts in default compose
- **Severity:** Medium (partially closed by V-003)
- **Category:** Infrastructure
- **Description:** `docker-compose.yml` still bind-mounts `./api:/app`
  into api and celery-worker containers. V-003 closed the admin
  equivalent; the api and celery mounts remain for dev convenience.
- **Suggested fix:** Remove from default compose. Move to
  `docker-compose.dev.yml` only.
- **Target version:** v1.4.

### V-079 -- No MFA for admin
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Category:** Auth
- **Description:** Admin accounts authenticate with username + password
  only. A stolen password is sufficient.
- **Suggested fix:** Add TOTP MFA as an ADMIN-role requirement, with a
  recovery-code flow for lockout.
- **Target version:** v1.4 or v2.0.

### DNS rebinding on connector SSRF guard
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Category:** Injection
- **Description:** V-009's guard resolves the hostname and checks the IP,
  but does not pin the resolved IP for the actual request. A hostname
  that returns a public IP on first lookup and a private IP on second
  lookup could bypass.
- **Suggested fix:** Resolve once, then make the HTTP request against
  the literal IP with the original Host header preserved. Reject when
  the resolution is non-deterministic.
- **Target version:** v1.4.
