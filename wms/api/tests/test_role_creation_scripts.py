"""End-to-end tests for the operator-run role-creation scripts in db/.

V-214 #170 shipped because no automated test exercised
db/role-snapshot-keeper.sql via the same invocation path an
operator runs. Whatever check existed during the v1.5.1 pre-merge
gate verified something other than "the role-creation script
actually creates the role." This file is the regression
guardrail: every role-creation script in db/ is tested by
spinning up a scratch DB, running the script via subprocess +
psql (the operator path), and asserting the role was created
with the expected grants and that the script exits non-zero on
internal failure.

Skip conditions:

  * psql binary not on PATH -- the api container does not bundle
    postgresql-client, so locally these tests skip with a clear
    message. CI runs on ubuntu-latest which has psql.
  * Script file not reachable -- protects the locally-skipped
    case from raising a path error.

The test invokes psql via subprocess so the variable-passing
semantics, ON_ERROR_STOP behavior, and \\gexec interpolation are
exercised exactly as an operator's runbook would. Importing the
SQL via psycopg or SQLAlchemy would test something other than
what an operator runs.
