"""emit_event: append a row to integration_events inside the caller's transaction.

Shaped after ``write_audit_log`` so every emit site reads identically.
The helper runs inside the caller's open transaction (no commit, no
rollback); ``integration_events.visible_at`` gets set by the deferred
trigger at COMMIT time so readers see events in commit order even when
BIGSERIAL assigned ``event_id`` values out of commit order (see
migration 020 for the full trigger contract).

Idempotency: the table's ``(aggregate_type, aggregate_id, event_type,
source_txn_id)`` UNIQUE constraint collapses retries of the same
logical request into a single row. ``INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO
NOTHING RETURNING event_id`` returns the new ``event_id`` on first
emit and ``None`` when the row was a duplicate; callers treat
``None`` as "already emitted, no-op."

Schema validation is gated by ``SENTRY_VALIDATE_EVENT_SCHEMAS`` (Decision U):

- ``true`` / ``1`` / ``yes``: validate every payload against the
  registered schema before insert. A mismatch raises; tests and CI run
  this way so code bugs fail loudly.
- anything else (default in production): skip validation and rely on
  the consumer's own validator. Prevents a payload-schema drift from
  blocking mobile writes in the warehouse.

v1.5.1 V-217 (umbrella #156): the env var is read on every emit via
``_validation_enabled()`` rather than snapshotted at module import.
An operator can flip the toggle during an incident and the next
emit reflects the new state without a worker restart.

    Looks up the cross_system_mappings table for the (source_type, canonical_id)
    pair and returns the source_id -- the identifier the upstream source system
    (e.g., "erp-connector") used when it Pipe-B pushed the entity to Sentry.

    Returns None when:
      * No mapping row exists (entity created directly in Sentry without a
        Pipe-B push, e.g., warehouse-floor manual entry).
      * canonical_id is None / empty.

    Caller pattern: COALESCE the result with the canonical UUID so the field
    always carries SOMETHING the consumer can act on:

        source_id = resolve_source_external_id(db, "sales_order", so.external_id)
        payload["sales_order_external_id"] = source_id or str(so.external_id)

    The canonical UUID stays available on `aggregate_id` (which is what
    Sentry consumers should use for cross-system idempotency anyway), so the
    fallback never strands the consumer with no identifier at all.

    source_system filter:
      When None (default), returns the most-recently-updated mapping for the
      pair. Single-source deployments (one upstream connector pushing per
      aggregate) only ever have one row, so ORDER-BY is a no-op there.
      Multi-source deployments should pass source_system explicitly to
      pick the right upstream identifier.

    NOTE on field naming: pre-this-change the Sentry event payload's
    *_external_id fields carried the canonical UUID ("the external id Sentry
    exposes externally"), forcing every consumer to do this same lookup
    against Sentry's API on every event. After this change those fields
    carry the source-system external_id ("the external id from the system
    that owns the data"), which matches the field-name convention used by
    every other event-integration system the maintainer knows of, and
    lets consumers process events without an out-of-band Sentry call.
