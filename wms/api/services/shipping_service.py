    (including the stranded header-SHIPPED / line-shipped=0 case) with the full
    fulfillment + audit bookkeeping, so the Create RMA button renders.

    Event emission splits on pre-ship status:
      * A stranded-SHIPPED SO already had its revenue/COGS booked in the GL at
        bulk-import time. Re-emitting ship.confirmed would double-count it
        downstream, so this path emits NOTHING -- the fulfillment + audit row
        are the whole correction.
      * A genuinely-unshipped PICKED / PACKED SO never reached the GL, so it
        DOES emit one ship.confirmed/1. Its carrier is derived from ship_method
        (an unshipped order has no carrier value yet).
    The already-fulfilled guard (409) still means at most one ship.confirmed is
    ever emitted per SO.

    A silent shortfall (a line under-picked with no SHORT / wave marker) is
    normally refused, but legacy imported orders never carry those markers -- so
    `acknowledge_shortfall=True` lets an admin ship the picked floor of a real
    pre-cutover partial. Ships ALL shippable lines (quantity_shipped =
    quantity_picked). Does NOT move inventory -- on-hand left the bin at pick
    time; stamping shipped is pure bookkeeping. Caller owns the transaction.
