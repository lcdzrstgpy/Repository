    leaves an OPEN batch the picker never saw; the rescan then collides with

        live work out from under them.

    A batch stays OPEN for its entire pick in this schema (nothing ever writes
    IN_PROGRESS), so status alone cannot tell an abandoned stub from an active
    walk -- the task state can. That is why the guard is progress-based, not
    status-based.

    """Cancel a batch and unwind every effect so the SOs in it are
    indistinguishable from "never started picking."

    Operator semantic (hotfix/picking-revert-allocation): cancel = wipe
    all progress, no Resume affordance. Whatever was picked goes back
    on the shelf (operator is responsible for physically returning),
    whatever was reserved is freed, the line counters reset, and the
    batch is marked CANCELLED.

    Per-task effects, branched on terminal pick_task.status:
      PENDING -> the task never fired. Decrement
        inventory.quantity_allocated by quantity_to_pick (release the
        bin reservation booked at create_pick_batch), decrement
        sales_order_lines.quantity_allocated by the same amount, flip
        the task to SKIPPED.
      PICKED -> units physically left the bin. add_inventory restores
        them to the source bin, decrement
        sales_order_lines.quantity_picked by quantity_picked AND
        quantity_allocated by quantity_to_pick, flip the task to
        RELEASED (matches the revert flow's terminal state).
        inventory.quantity_allocated was already cleared at
        confirm_pick time, so no inventory.allocated change here.
      SHORT -> the operator picked quantity_picked and shorted the
        rest. add_inventory restores those quantity_picked units to
        the bin if > 0, decrement sol.quantity_picked /
        quantity_allocated. inventory.quantity_allocated was already
        cleared at short_pick. Task flips to SKIPPED (the original
        SHORT signal is preserved in audit; for cancel we want the
        line back to clean).
      SKIPPED / RELEASED -> already terminal, no-op (idempotent
        re-entry).

    Writes one SO_PICK_RELEASED audit row per task whose
    quantity_picked > 0 (the physical inventory event), plus one
    SO_ALLOCATION_RELEASED row per task whose allocation was undone
    (the line-state event). TO-batch lanes are out of scope: this
    helper only revert SO picks; TO unwind goes through the existing
    transfer_order_service helpers."""
