"""Server-owned descriptions for every error_kind the dispatcher
emits. The dispatcher sets ``webhook_deliveries.error_detail`` to
the catalog ``short_message`` so the column never holds bytes the
consumer's endpoint controlled (its response body, library
exception strings echoing internals, etc.).

The admin webhook-errors viewer joins ``error_kind`` to this
catalog at response time to render ``description`` and
``triage_hint``. None of those strings come from the consumer.
