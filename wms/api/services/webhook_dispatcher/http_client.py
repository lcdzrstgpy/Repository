"""HTTP client for the v1.6.0 webhook dispatcher (plan §2.1, §4.1).

D8 fills in the D5 placeholder. ``requests.Session`` factory,
``verify=True`` always, ``allow_redirects=False``, full error-
kind classification mapping ``requests`` / ``urllib3`` exceptions
to the documented enum.

TLS policy invariants:

  * ``verify=True`` always at this layer. The
    ``SENTRY_ALLOW_HTTP_WEBHOOKS`` opt-out only relaxes the
    scheme check at admin time; cert verification at dispatch
    time is non-negotiable.
  * ``allow_redirects=False``. A 3xx response classifies as a
    ``4xx`` failure (consumer-side wire-contract violation);
    following redirects would let a malicious consumer bounce
    traffic to an internal target.

The CI lint added in D1 (this commit retained) enforces no
disabled-TLS-verification keyword argument anywhere under
``api/services/webhook_dispatcher/``.
