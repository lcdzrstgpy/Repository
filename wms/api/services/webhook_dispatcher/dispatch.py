"""Per-subscription delivery loop (plan §2.3 + §1.6).

D5 fills in the dispatch surface: read pending rows from
``webhook_deliveries``, sign via :mod:`signing`, POST to the
consumer URL, update state. The single-serialization invariant
(plan §3.1) gets its runtime assertion here at the HTTP-client
boundary -- the bytes passed to the HTTP client MUST equal
``signed.body`` produced by :func:`signing.sign_request`. A
refactor that introduces a transformation between sign and send
surfaces as ``AssertionError``.

Cursor semantics (plan §1.6): ``webhook_subscriptions
.last_delivered_event_id`` advances strictly on terminal state
(``succeeded`` or ``dlq``), never on in-progress (``pending`` /
``in_flight``) or non-terminal failures (``failed``). D5 covers
``succeeded``; D6 covers the ``dlq`` flip.

Head-of-line blocking (plan §2.5): a stuck or retrying event
blocks newer events on the same subscription. The cursor is the
mechanism: D5 selects the next event ONLY after the previous
event terminated. The test suite locks this invariant; an
operational consequence (auto-pause at ceilings) lands in D7.

Consumer dedupe contract (plan §3.1): the dedupe key is
``event_id`` from the envelope BODY, not the
``X-Sentry-Delivery-Id`` header. The header is a composite
``f"{event_id}:{timestamp}"`` scoped to a specific delivery
attempt; a consumer that dedupes on the header would mistake
two retries of the same event for two distinct events. The
runbook (R3) and the consumer integration guide
(``docs/api/webhooks.md``) state this explicitly.

Auto-pause invariants (plan §2.11, landed in D7):

  * After a non-terminal failure (D6 retry-slot INSERT), the
    pending count for the subscription is checked. If it has
    reached ``pending_ceiling``, the subscription flips to
    ``status='paused'`` with ``pause_reason='pending_ceiling'``
    in the same transaction as the failed-row write. A
    ``paused`` event is published on the
    ``webhook_subscription_events`` channel so peer workers
    evict their state.
  * After a terminal failure (D6 dlq flip), the DLQ count for
    the subscription is checked. If it has reached
    ``dlq_ceiling``, the same auto-pause path fires with
    ``pause_reason='dlq_ceiling'``.
  * Hard caps from ``DISPATCHER_MAX_PENDING_HARD_CAP`` /
    ``DISPATCHER_MAX_DLQ_HARD_CAP`` bound per-subscription
    overrides at admin-set time (A1 owns the upper-bound
    check; D7 lands the env-validator plumbing only).
  * Audit_log writes on each auto-pause are deferred to A1
    when webhook admin CRUD wires the audit_log hash chain.
    D7 logs CRITICAL on every auto-pause so the operator
    sees it in compose logs immediately.

Worker eviction (plan §2.9 + D5 follow-up #177):

  * A ``paused`` or ``deleted`` event on the pubsub channel
    triggers ``SubscriptionWorkerPool._run_fanout`` to call
    ``request_eviction()`` on the matching worker. The worker
    closes its psycopg2 connection (which surfaces as a clean
    exception in any in-flight SELECT), the run-loop exits,
    and the next ``_refresh_active_subscriptions`` cycle
    prunes the dead worker via the existing dead-worker
    pruning logic from D5.

D5 explicitly does NOT include:
  * Retry schedule (D6) -- D5 marks failures as ``failed`` and
    leaves the next-attempt scheduling to D6.
  * Ceiling auto-pause (D7) -- D5 ignores ``status='paused'``
    subscriptions but does not flip them.
  * HTTP client policy (D8) -- D5 uses a placeholder
    ``requests.post`` invocation with ``verify=True`` and
    ``timeout=10`` baked in; D8 replaces with a full Session
    factory + connection pool + error-kind classification.
  * Rate limiter (D9), graceful shutdown drain (D10), SSRF
    guard (D11), strict-typed filter (D12), cross-worker
    publisher (D4).

    This is the RUNNING counterpart to :func:`reset_orphaned_in_flight`
    (which fires once at boot and resets EVERY in_flight row because
    nothing is legitimately in flight at boot). At steady state a
    delivery is legitimately ``in_flight`` only for the duration of one
    HTTP send -- bounded by the wall-clock watchdog in
    :meth:`http_client.HttpClient.send` (default 10s). ``older_than_s``
    is the age gate that distinguishes a wedged row from a live one;
    it MUST stay comfortably above that wall-clock cap (env_validator
    floors it at 30s, ~3x the default cap) so the reaper can never
    race a delivery that is still in progress.

    With fix #1 (DNS resolution moved inside the watchdog) a row no
    longer stays ``in_flight`` past ~10s for the DNS-hang trigger, so
    this reaper rarely fires. It is defense-in-depth for the other
    ways a row could wedge without a watchdog around it -- e.g. the
    process being hard-killed between the in_flight commit and the
    terminal write, or a hang in the sign/secret-load step that runs
    before the HTTP send. A reclaimed row retries on the next cycle;
    the consumer dedupes on event_id, so a reclaim that races a
    genuinely-slow delivery is at worst one harmless duplicate POST.

    ``make_interval`` keeps the threshold a bound parameter rather
