"""Wake orchestrator: LISTEN/NOTIFY + 2s fallback poll + Redis pubsub.

Three sources merge into one in-process queue per plan section 2.2:

  1. **LISTEN/NOTIFY** on ``integration_events_visible`` (migration
     031, #164). Sub-millisecond wake when an emit-site INSERT
     transitions ``visible_at`` from NULL -> NOT NULL. Each notify
     enqueues a :class:`WakeEvent` of kind ``"fresh_event"``
     carrying the ``event_id``.

  2. **Fallback poll** every ``DISPATCHER_FALLBACK_POLL_MS``.
     Catches NOTIFYs missed across a listener disconnect (NOTIFY
     is not durable). Each tick enqueues a ``"poll_all"`` event;
     the consumer (D5) treats this as "scan every active
     subscription for pending work."

  3. **Redis pubsub** on the ``webhook_subscription_events``
     channel for cross-worker invalidation per plan section 2.9.
     Mirrors the V-205 #146 ``token_cache`` subscriber shape:
     lazy ``import redis``, soft-fail when Redis is unavailable
     (LISTEN+poll continue working), and a daemon thread that
     parses payloads into ``"subscription_event"`` queue entries.

Lifecycle is owned by :class:`WakeOrchestrator`:

  * ``start()`` opens the LISTEN connection + spawns three daemon
    threads.
  * ``shutdown()`` sets the shared shutdown event AND closes the
    LISTEN connection + Redis pubsub so the threads break out of
    their blocking I/O calls instead of waiting for their
    select-timeout cycle.
  * ``join(timeout_s)`` waits for the threads; soft-fails (logs)
    if any do not exit within the window so a wedged thread is
    visible in shutdown logs but does not block the daemon's
    process exit.

The dispatch loop body that drains the queue (D5) is intentionally
left out of this commit; the queue is the boundary between D3
(producer side) and D5 (consumer side). D1's heartbeat-only main
loop drains and DEBUG-logs queue entries during D3 so the queue
does not grow unbounded; D5 replaces that drain with the real
per-subscription delivery loop.

    dispatcher's main path.

    Plan §2.9: peer workers act on the message per the action
    table. The dispatcher (D7) calls this from auto-pause; the
    admin endpoints (A1/A2) call it on every paused / resumed /
    deleted / delivery_url_changed / rate_limit_changed /
    secret_rotated mutation.

    Lives in wake.py (rather than dispatch.py) so the
    cross-worker pubsub plumbing -- subscribe (already here)
    plus publish (this function) -- is colocated. Also keeps
    the D2 single-serialization lint from catching a second
    json.dumps in dispatch.py: that lint protects the envelope
    sign-and-send path; the pubsub payload is unrelated.

    no log; the api container shipped without REDIS_URL and admin
    PATCH handlers reported success while peer workers observed
    stale subscription state for up to the 60s refresh cycle. The
    counter surfaces via WakeOrchestrator.health_snapshot() so an
    operator can grep whether the publish path is alive at a
