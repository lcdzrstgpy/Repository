"""HMAC-SHA256 signer with 24-hour dual-accept rotation (plan §3).

Three responsibilities:

1. Hold per-subscription HMAC secret material in a wrapper
   (:class:`SecretMaterial`) that refuses to leak plaintext via
   ``repr``, ``str``, or ``%r`` formatting (plan §3.2).
2. Compute the canonical signing input ``f"{timestamp}.{body}"``
   and HMAC-SHA256 it (plan §3.1). The body bytes are produced
   exactly once by :mod:`envelope` and reused unchanged across
   sign and send (single-serialization invariant).
3. Verify a given signature against one or more candidate
   secrets in constant time via ``hmac.compare_digest``,
   supporting the 24-hour dual-accept rotation window.

The dispatcher signs with ``generation=1`` only. Consumers
accept either generation until ``expires_at`` (plan §3.2). The
verifier here is consumer-shaped and used by the test suite to
assert wire-compatibility; the production dispatcher only
exercises :func:`sign_request`.

Plaintext lifecycle (plan §3.2): the SENTRY_ENCRYPTION_KEY
master key decrypts ``webhook_secrets.secret_ciphertext`` into a
local variable inside this module; the plaintext is wrapped in
``SecretMaterial`` and never crosses the call stack out as a raw
``bytes`` object. ``SecretMaterial.__repr__`` is loud-safe;
``SecretMaterial.__str__`` raises so an accidental ``f"{secret}"``
coerce surfaces as a TypeError instead of a silent leak.
