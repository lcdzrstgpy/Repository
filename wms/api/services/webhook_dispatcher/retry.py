"""Retry schedule + terminal-attempt classification.

Hard-coded eight-slot exponential schedule. Cumulative window
between attempt 1 and the 8th-attempt DLQ flip is ~14.6h
(close to the documented ~15h). An event that fails every
attempt sits in ``webhook_deliveries`` for that window before
terminating in ``dlq`` and the cursor advancing.

#234 (V-316): each retry slot carries a +/-10% jitter applied
per attempt. Without jitter, multiple subscriptions whose first
delivery to the same consumer URL fails at the same minute
retry at the same minute every retry slot, giving the consumer
a synchronized retry storm indistinguishable from a coordinated
DoS. The cumulative window stays inside the documented ~15h
budget (worst case +10% on every slot is still under ~17h, so
the bound is bounded). Per-attempt jitter does NOT decorrelate
adjacent retries on the SAME delivery (one delivery is one
fan-in to one consumer), but it does decorrelate retries
ACROSS deliveries that share the same nominal slot.

The schedule itself is deliberately public: a consumer that
needs to budget its own incident response can plan against the
documented cumulative window.

Schema invariant pairs with this module: migration 030 (#166)
constrains ``webhook_deliveries.attempt_number BETWEEN 1 AND
8``. A code-only refactor that bumped MAX_ATTEMPTS beyond 8
would surface as a CHECK violation at INSERT time -- the
bottom rung that catches the slip before the database is
contaminated with out-of-band rows.

Indexing convention:

  * Attempt 1 fires at NOW() with no delay (D5 INSERTs the
    initial pending row at scheduled_at=NOW()).
  * For attempts 2..8, the delay BEFORE the attempt fires is
    ``RETRY_SCHEDULE_SECONDS[next_attempt_number - 1]``
    multiplied by a per-call jitter factor in [0.9, 1.1].
  * Slot 0 (1 second) is reserved; v1.6.0 does not consume it
    because the visible_at gate (2s) covers commit-vs-poll
    races.
  * Slot 7 (12 hours) is the wait BEFORE attempt 8.
