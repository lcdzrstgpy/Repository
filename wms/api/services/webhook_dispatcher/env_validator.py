"""Boot-time env-var validators for the webhook dispatcher (plan §2.10).

Mirrors the V-201 #142 weak-pepper validation shape and the V-206
#147 dangerous-combination boot guard shape from v1.5.1. Each
range validator rejects out-of-band values with a clear message
naming the offending var and its allowed range; each combination
guard refuses to boot (or logs CRITICAL on every boot, in the
softer cases) when two safe values combine into a dangerous one.

The dispatcher's daemon entry point calls ``validate_or_die()`` at
boot. A misconfigured deployment fails fast with a message naming
the variable to fix; deployments that pass keep the env values
available via :func:`int_var` / :func:`bool_var` helpers that
re-read on every call (so a runtime toggle takes effect on the
next read, mirroring the V-217 #156 lesson on module-level env
reads -- never freeze a tunable at import).
