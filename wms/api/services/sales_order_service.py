"""Sales-order shared service.

v1.9.0 introduces one shared cancel handler. Two callers converge here:

- Admin operator path: POST /api/admin/sales-orders/<id>/cancel
  (and /cancel-backorder, which delegates here after stamping
  cancellation_reason).
- Inbound path: an ERP-pushed update on an existing SO whose
  canonical status field has flipped to CANCELLED.

The cancel transition is the only state-changing SO operation that
historically did NOT write audit_log; routing both paths through this
service closes that hole and gives the inventory unwind one source of
truth.

Backorders add two things on top:

- Parent-cancel cascade: after the per-status unwind, any non-terminal
  child backorder (order_type='backorder') is recursively cancelled
  with cancellation_reason='parent_cancelled'. Keeps Sentry from
  stranding a BO when the parent is cancelled.
- backorder.cancelled emit: when the SO being cancelled is itself a
  BO (order_type='backorder'), emit on the integration_events outbox
  so the Teams adapter / future marketplace adapter see the event.
  The operator-initiated path and the cascade both emit; no consumer
  needs to know which.

The emit relies on the Flask request context for source_txn_id /
user_external_id, mirroring complete_batch's pattern. Outside a
request (unit tests that call cancel_sales_order directly) the emit
is skipped.

    Locks the sales_orders row with FOR UPDATE so a concurrent ship /

    - OPEN: if the SO has been allocated to an active pick batch
      (sales_order_lines.quantity_allocated > 0), release the
      inventory.quantity_allocated, delete pending pick_tasks +
      pick_batch_orders; otherwise status flip only. PICKING was
      retired in mig 060, so allocation state replaces it as the
      "is this inside a batch?" signal.
    - PICKED / PACKED: increment inventory.quantity_on_hand at the
      default receiving bin by each line's quantity_picked, reset
      sales_order_lines.quantity_picked / quantity_packed = 0 and
      status = 'PENDING'. Pre-existing PICKED pick_tasks rows stay in
      place as the audit trail of what happened. Operators move items
      physically; the inventory record reflects the ERP-mandated state.
    - SHIPPED: raises CancelNotAllowed; caller returns 4xx. The dockd
      void-ship route is the path for SHIPPED reversal.

    Args:
        so_id: sales_orders.so_id.
        source: "admin" or "inbound" (lands in audit_log.details.source).
        username: actor for audit_log.user_id.

    Returns dict with pre_status, so_number, audit_log_id (None on the
    idempotent already-cancelled path), and deferred_notifications: a
    list of (event_type, payload, warehouse_id) tuples the caller must
    fire AFTER its own commit (each entry typically maps to a
    fire-and-forget Teams card). The list aggregates across the

# Admin virtual pick
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Operator-driven shortcut: an admin marks a sales order picked through the
# admin UI without the handheld going out on the floor. Used when the floor
# work already happened but the digital pick never landed -- e.g. legacy
# ShipRush bridge, a stuck batch, or an SO that arrived already-fulfilled.
#
# The end state must be indistinguishable from a real pick:
#   * sales_order_lines.quantity_picked carries the picked qty per line
#   * inventory.quantity_on_hand decrements at the chosen bin per pick
#   * audit log carries one ACTION_PICK row per pick (entity_type='SO')
#   * pick.confirmed integration event fires when the SO flips to PICKED
#
# Symmetry with handheld picks comes from synthesising a one-shot
# pick_batch (status COMPLETED at insert) and one pick_task per pick
# entry. The existing _revert_so_status path takes pick_task_ids as input
# and walks the same release SQL regardless of how the task was created,
# so a virtual pick can be undone through the same "Release Picked
# Quantities" UI as a real pick. No second undo path needed.
