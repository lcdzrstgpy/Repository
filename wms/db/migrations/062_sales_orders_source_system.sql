-- 062: denormalise the SO's originating source_system
-- onto the sales_orders row so the admin SO edit surface can edit it
-- without touching the inbound history. Pre-P7 the only path to the
-- source_system was sales_orders.latest_inbound_id ->
-- inbound_sales_orders.source_system, which is read-mostly and not
-- always populated (admin-created and POS-created SOs have no inbound
-- row at all).
--
-- Adding the column directly:
--   * lets a CSR repoint an SO that ingested under the wrong system
--     tag (e.g. shopify-us when it should have been shopify-ca) via
--     PUT /admin/sales-orders/<id> without rewriting inbound history.
--   * gives POS / admin-created SOs a real source_system value (NULL
--     pre-P7 because there was no inbound row to derive from).
--   * stays FK-referenced to inbound_source_systems_allowlist so the
--     value is always one of the canonical tags.
--
-- Backfill walks the latest applied inbound row per SO. SOs without an
-- inbound history (admin-created, POS-created) stay NULL and become
-- editable from the admin SO page.

-- external_id, received_at DESC) WHERE status='applied' so the
-- correlated subquery is index-only.
