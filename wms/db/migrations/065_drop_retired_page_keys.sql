-- Migration 065: retire the admin-side picking/packing/shipping page
-- mirrors. The actual workflow lives on the handheld scanners; the
-- admin pages duplicated state without adding control surface, so they
-- were removed.
--
-- The user_page_permissions table has no CHECK constraint on page_key
-- (deliberately -- see migration 061's header), so stale rows for
-- retired keys linger without preventing reads. Clearing them here
-- keeps the permission grid in the Users page in sync with
-- ALL_PAGE_KEYS and prevents a "ghost" grant from re-appearing if the
-- keys are ever re-introduced.
--
-- Idempotent: WHERE filters by the retired set; a re-run finds zero
-- rows and is a no-op.

DELETE FROM user_page_permissions
 WHERE page_key IN ('picking', 'packing', 'shipping');
